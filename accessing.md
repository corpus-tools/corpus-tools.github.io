## Accessing ANNIS

ANNIS is currently being developed within research project 
[D1: "Linguistic Database for Information Structure:
Annotation and Retrieval"](https://www.sfb632.uni-potsdam.de/en/cprojects/d1.html), 
[LAUDATIO](http://www.laudatio-repository.org/) and 
[Georgetown Corpus Linguistics](http://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu). 
ANNIS is an open source project under the 
[Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/) (though access to many of the corpora in the system is
restricted by licenses) and is based on freely available open
source technologies ([PostgreSQL DB](http://www.postgresql.org), the 
[Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/) Java framework
and a browser such as [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/)).
The source code is available from the download page.
Currently three versions can be accessed on-line ( 
**for best results use [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) or Internet Explorer above version
8**- older versions of IE have some known issues):

* A [demo version](https://korpling.german.hu-berlin.de/annis3/) with a small sample of freely
  available corpora in Berlin (also available from the [Demo Corpora](corpora.html) page)
* The [Georgetown University ANNIS](http://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/annis-corpora/) runs some freely
  available corpora
* The [SFB 632](https://annis2.sfb632.uni-potsdam.de) instance for SFB researchers and other partners (login
  required)
* The latest experimental [developer's version](https://korpling.german.hu-berlin.de/annis3-snapshot/) for testing.


If you are interested in obtaining a login or joining the ANNIS
user and developer mailing list, please contact us at

We also welcome [cooperation partners](cooperations.html) interested in
developing interesting corpora or expansions to the pluggable
architecture, such as visualization modules and query builder
modules.
