# Legacy Tools

These are tools that used to be activly developed, but now are on maintenance mode and are only receiving bug-fixes but no new features.
They can be used as usual, but you should check if an activly maintained tool is available for the same task.

- [Pepper](../archive-2015-2025/pepper/): A highly extensible plattform for conversion and manipulation of linguistic data between an unbound set of formats. Pepper can be used stand-alone as a command line interface, or be integrated as an API into other software products. [^annatto]
- [Hexatomic](../archive-2015-2025/hexatomic/):  A cross-platform multi-layer corpus annotation tool – and extensible platform – for the desktop.
- [Salt](../archive-2015-2025/salt/): A powerful, tagset-independent and theory-neutral meta model and API for storing, manipulating, and representing nearly all types of linguistic data.

[^annatto]: Replaced by [Annatto](/annatto)
