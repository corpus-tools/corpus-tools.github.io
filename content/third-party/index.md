# Third-Party Tools

## Annimate: Your Friendly ANNIS Match Exporter

![Screenshot of the Annimate user interface](images/annimate-screenshot.png)

Annimate (for ANNIS Match Exporter) is a tool for the convenient export of query results (matches) from the [ANNIS](../annis).
It is meant as a supplement to the ANNIS web interface and focuses on file export (as opposed to visualization) of the results of an ANNIS query.
