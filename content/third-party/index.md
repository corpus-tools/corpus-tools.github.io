## Annimate: Your Friendly ANNIS Match Exporter


Annimate (for ANNIS Match Exporter) is a tool for the convenient export of query results (matches) from the [ANNIS](../annis).
It is meant as a supplement to the ANNIS web interface and focuses on file export (as opposed to visualization) of the results of an ANNIS query.
