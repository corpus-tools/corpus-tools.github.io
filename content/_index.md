With corpus-tools.org we provide software to **annotate, migrate, and analyze linguistic data**.
The tools are currently maintained by the  [Corpus Linguistics and Morphology group](https://www.linguistik.hu-berlin.de/en/institut-en/professuren-en/korpuslinguistik/standardseite-en?set_language=en) from the Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin, but a lot of individuals and research projects have contributed to these tools.
