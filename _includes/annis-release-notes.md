### Fixed

- Fix several issues with corpora containing an Umlaut or other special
  characters. There is often now a distinction between using the decoded corpus
  name or the "raw" node names, e.g. to get the corpus or HTML visualizer
  configuration. This also updates graphANNIS to 2.0.3 which includes the
  corresponding fixes.
