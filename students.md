## Student Work on ANNIS

If you are a student in Berlin/Potsdam/Washington DC and are
interested in writing a final paper (**Studienarbeit,
Diplomarbeit, QP** etc.) or working part time
(**SHK-Stelle**) within the ANNIS project, please let us know!
We're always looking for people with good database, XML and JAVA
programming skills, and our staff is always learning and
experimenting with the latest tools and methods.

Work supervised within the project so far includes:

* Karsten Hütter: Entwicklung einer
  Benutzerschnittstelle für die Suche in linguistischen
  mehrebenen Korpora unter Betrachtung softwareergonomischer
  Gesichtspunkte (supervised by Ulf Leser, Hartmut Wandke)
  \[[Exposé](http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/forschung/gebiete/wbi/teaching/studienDiplomArbeiten/finished/2008/huetter_expose_080404.pdf)\]
* Florian Zipser: Entwicklung eines (Meta-)Modells für
linguistisch annotierte Daten (supervised by Ulf Leser, Anke
Lüdeling) \[[Diplomarbeit - Exposé](http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/forschung/gebiete/wbi/teaching/studienDiplomArbeiten/finished/2009/Expose_zipser_090316.pdf)\]
* Viktor Rosenfeld: An Implementation of the Annis 2 Query
Language (supervised by Ulf Leser) \[[Studienarbeit](http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/forschung/gebiete/wbi/teaching/studienDiplomArbeiten/finished/2010/rosenfeld_studienarbeit.pdf)\]
* Viktor Rosenfeld: Implementation of a Linguistic Query
Language on top of a Column-Oriented Main-Memory Database
(supervised by Ulf Leser, Stefan Manegold) \[[Diplomarbeit - exposé](http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/forschung/gebiete/wbi/teaching/studienDiplomArbeiten/finished/2012/rosenfeld_expose_111021.pdf)\]

Some open topics we would like to encourage students to work
on include:

### Search

* Negation of relational operators with and without implied
existence assumption (e.g. looking for nodes dominated by nodes
**not meeting a criterion** or **not dominated by certain
nodes**, and similarly for other operators)
* Expanding query functionality with aggregate functions and
statistical output (counting different features for nodes and
edges, performing mathematical manipulations on them and
outputting certain data structures)
* Extending AQL with new types of value matches, especially
numerical operators
* Modelling 'empty' tokens - how should the system behave for
annotations which apply to no text at all or between tokens?
(e.g. linguistically motivated traces, pro-forms ...)
* Developing export/re-import workflows for correcting and
extending annotations

### Visualization

* Visualizing parallel corpora (correspondences between flat
text in multiple languages as well as parallel graphs involving
higher structures)
* Creating user friendly, customizable statistical views of
aggregate data
* Expressing part-whole relationships between tokens and
subtokens with hierarchically conflicting spans
* Visualization of transitive pointing relations between
tokens, such as dependency edges
* User-oriented optimization and customization of the
interface
