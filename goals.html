<h2>Challenges and Goals</h2>
<!-- The heterogenity of the data in the SFB poses high requirements on the web application: -->
  <h3>Diversity
of primary data</h3>
Language data can be very heterogeneous and may come from
typologically diverse languages. It differs with respect to modality
(written vs. spoken language, monologue vs. dialogue) and basic unit
(sentence vs. discourse). In addition, special character sets (e.g.
for Hindi, Old High German or the African Kwa languages) mean that full
    <strong>Unicode</strong>
support is essential, in both visualization and search facilities.
The system also offers support for <b>right-to-left</b>
script languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew. This includes <b>right-to-left
tree layouting</b> for treebanks in
these languages.<br>

  <h3>Diversity of Annotation</h3>
Data is annotated on various linguistic levels: phonetics/phonology,
morpho-syntax, semantics, and information structure.
The data types of the annotation range from attribute-value pairs to
set relations (e.g. for annotating co-reference), directed
relations/pointers (e.g. for annotating anaphoric relations), trees,
and graphs (see <a href="visualizations.html">Visualizations</a>).
Furthermore, the annotations are created with the help of different
tools, i.e. different tool formats have to be supported. In order to ensure
compatibility with as many formats as possible, we use the <a href="http://u.hu-berlin.de/saltnpepper">SaltNPepper
converter framework</a>, which maps a large number of formats via the metamodel Salt into relANNIS (the native format of ANNIS).<br>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td> <center>
 <img src="img/formats.png"
 alt="Data from multiple annotation tools is searchable in ANNIS"
 border="1" vspace="6" width="400">
          </center>  </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
          <center> <strong><font size="-1">ANNIS allows searches
simultaneously incorporating data  <br> from multiple tools and formats,
such as EXMARaLDA and Tiger XML, <br> or MMAX2 and RSTTool annotations</font></strong>
          </center>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
<br>
<h3>Multilayer Annotation</h3>
<p>A very central requirement is support for visualizing and querying
annotations on multiple layers, each layer representing one type of
information, e.g. morphemic transcription, grammatical functions, pitch
accents, etc. Queries must be able to simultaneously constrain all
these layers and the relationships between them, making operators for
the description of topological tree structures as well as span overlap
necessary (see <a href="aql">ANNIS Query Language - AQL</a>). The system also supports parallel corpora aligned at all levels (i.e. words, sentences, syntactic phrases etc. can be aligned), and each aligned language may have its own annotation layers.</p>
    <br>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
          <center> <img src="img/parallel.png"
 alt="Parallel aligned data with a separate syntax tree for each language"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 600px; height: 400px;"></center>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
          <center> <strong><font size="-1">Parallel aligned data with a separate syntax tree for each language</font></strong>
          </center>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
<br>
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>Data in the database should be easy to access and to query. Software
and hardware requirements on the client side should be limited to a
freely available browser (e.g. Mozilla Firefox). As little training as
possible should be required, making a graphical query builder as well
as corpus-specific example queries and tutorials necessary.
</p>
<h3>Performance and Scalability</h3>
<p>Queries should return results reasonably quickly, even in large datasets. In order to realize this, the original data from XML and other formats is compiled and stored in the ANNIS backend within a relational database (<a
 href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>),
which offers scalability and access speed not feasible for an XML DB,
as well as native RegEx support.</p>
